Acceptance Criteria
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

=============================================================================================


6. Define the controllers: Define the controller functions that handle the business logic for each API route. For example, the `GET /products` route might call a `getAllProducts` function that queries the database for all products.

8. Deploy the application: Deploy your Express.js application to a server or cloud platform so that it can be accessed by your users.
